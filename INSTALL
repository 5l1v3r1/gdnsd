Building From Source
====================

In general, this is a standard autoconf-style project: ./configure && make check && sudo make install

If your starting point is a tarball download, the following prerequisites apply:

* A basically functional POSIX build environment with a C99 compiler
* libev headers and libraries, version 4.x: distro pkg or http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html

The following are optional, but generally recommended:

* liburcu aka userspace-rcu headers and libraries. Use distro pkg or http://lttng.org/urcu/

The following have no real effect on the build or runtime, but are required in order to run the testsuite:

* Perl 5.8.1 or higher
* Perl modules: LWP 5.805+, Socket6, IO::Socket::INET6, HTTP::Daemon

If working directly from a git clone rather than a tarball, in addition to all of the above:

* ./autogen.sh will construct the configure script to get started
* You may need to install updated autoconf, automake, and libtool packages
* You will need a working copy of Ragel: http://www.complang.org/ragel/ (or distro package)
* Use "git clean -dfx" to reset to a truly clean state (could wipe local edits!)

Interesting / Non-standard autoconf options
===========================================

--with-systemd
  Turns on compile-time support for running as a systemd service.
  You want this iff your Linux distribution uses systemd.  Turns
  on sd_notify() of the MAINPID during startup.
  Note that currently there is no support for gdnsd's standard fast,
  overlapped restart behavior under systemd, as systemd has no
  apparent capability to handle this concept.  "systemctl restart"
  will result in a full shutdown and then a full startup, sequentially,
  and a systemd-started gdnsd can't be fast-restarted from outside
  of systemctl, either.

--with-systemd-hax
  Implies --with-systemd.  Turns on some hacky, unclean code to
  get the standard "fast, overlapped restart" behavior of gdnsd
  to work via systemd's ExecReload (thus requiring you to send
  real SIGHUP from outside of systemctl to replace the missing
  true reload command).  It's very likely that these hacks
  will become broken in future systemd versions (or are already
  broken on a distro I didn't test!)

--enable-developer
  Builds a debugging build (-g) with a lot of extra gcc warnings
    flags, a large suite of assert()ions, and extra
    informative debug information via STDERR or syslog().
    It also does other excessive runtime checks that really
    slow things down.
  Not generally for production use.  If you just want debug
    symbols, put -g in your CFLAGS.

--with-testport=N
  The test suite needs to be able to bind to 3 consecutive ports
   on 127.0.0.1, starting with port N.  The default is 12345.  If
   this conflicts with some existing service on your machine, change
   it here.

--without-urcu
  Explicitly disable support for liburcu (falls back to pthread locks)

--with-rundir=/some/where
  Set an alternate system-level rundir, e.g. in situations where a Linux
  distro wants to use "/run" in place of "/var/run".
