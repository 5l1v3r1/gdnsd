/***************
 * These are Public-Domain JKISS32/JLKISS64 PRNG implementations
 *   which I initially got from David Jones' RNG paper here:
 *   http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.jones/GoodPracticeRNG.pdf
 *   ... and then incorporated some usage/optimization hints from
 *   https://github.com/bhickey/librng
 * The actual algorithms ultimately came from George Marsaglia.
 * I've made cosmetic modifications (style, C99) and given them a
 *  state pointer for threading, and renamed them into the gdnsd API
 *  namespace so they can be swapped out easily later, and given them
 *  initialization from quality libsodium sources.

/* Note there are separate 64-bit and 32-bit interfaces here.
 * Both have periods sufficient for this software in general,
 *   given an analysis of high end per-thread DNS query rates and
 *   daemon uptimes, etc.  The 32-bit one is faster and should
 *   be used by default.
 * The 64-bit one is supplied for cases (such as plugin_weighted)
 *   where the result is being used in an integer modulo operation
 *   with unpredictable mod values which could be large enough to
 *   induce bias with the 32-bit one.
 * For "gdnsd_rand32_get() % N":
 *     maxN -> bias
 *     ----    ----
 *     2^24 -> 0.39%
 *     2^28 -> 6.25%
 *     2^29 -> 12.5%
 *     2^30 -> 25%
 * ... whereas rand64_get() will have an almost immeasurably small
 *   bias for modvals up to 2^32.
