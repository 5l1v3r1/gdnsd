/**********************************************************************
 * There's really no good way around the dlsym problem, but this
 *  contains the ugliness to this one tiny source file.  This method
 *  throws aliasing warnings (which are probably technically correct),
 *  and the only other sane method will throw required warnings about
 *  casting between function and object pointers (which is technically
 *  undefined behavior in Standard C).  In either case, POSIX requires
 *  that the pointer works as expected in practice.
