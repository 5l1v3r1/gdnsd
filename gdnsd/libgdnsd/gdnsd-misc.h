// In the common case of dynamic modulo values in code, the maximum
//  bias is proportional the maximum modulo your code uses, and the
//  bias can be significant for _get32() cases.
// Examples: max_modulo vs _get32() -> bias
//  2^20 -> 0.02%
//  2^24 -> 0.4%
//  2^28 -> 6.25%
//  2^29 -> 12.5%
//  2^30 -> 25%
//  2^32-1 -> 50%
// Whereas _get64() will have a bias < 0.00000003% for any modulo
//  that's 2^32 or smaller.
