gdnsd-plugin-api - How to write gdnsd plugin code

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  Mandatory preamble macro+header your source must include at the top:
    #define GDNSD_PLUGIN_NAME foo
    #include <gdnsd/plugin.h>

  Callback hooks you may implement (all are optional, and executed in this order):
    -- startup/config stuff:
    # only 'checkconf', 'start', 'restart', 'condrestart' invoke plugin callbacks at all
    mon_list_t* plugin_foo_load_config(const vscf_data_t* pc)
    void plugin_foo_add_svctype(const char* name, const vscf_data_t* svc_cfg, const unsigned interval, const unsigned timeout)
    void plugin_foo_full_config(unsigned num_threads)
    void plugin_foo_add_monitor(const char* svc_name, mon_smgr_t* smgr)
    # only 'start', 'restart', and 'condrestart' continue past this point
    void plugin_foo_post_daemonize(void)
    void plugin_foo_pre_privdrop(void)
    void plugin_foo_init_monitors(struct ev_loop* mon_loop)
    void plugin_foo_start_monitors(struct ev_loop* mon_loop)
    void plugin_foo_pre_run(struct ev_loop* loop)
    void plugin_foo_iothread_init(unsigned threadnum)

    -- runtime stuff (called from iothread context, anytime after iothread_init())
    void plugin_foo_resolve(unsigned threadnum, unsigned resnum, const uint8_t* origin, const client_info_t* cinfo, dyn_result_t* result)

    -- runtime stuff (called from main or zonefile thread, anytime after full_config())
    --   (you won't get parallel calls to this, and in general it should be a readonly
    --    operation anyways)
    int plugin_foo_map_res(const char* resname, const uint8_t* origin)

    -- cleanup stuff:
    void plugin_foo_exit(void)

=head1 WARNING

Please note that in general, gdnsd's plugin API is poorly documented
and unstable.  It often goes through fairly large and abrupt changes
during development cycles, although it tends to be stable for a given
stable release series.  Write code against it at your own peril
(or at least, let me know so I can give you some warning on upcoming
changes and/or solicit your feedback!).

=head1 OVERVIEW

This file documents version 13 of the gdnsd plugin API.

L<gdnsd>'s plugin API offers the ability to write plugins that can
do either (or both) of two roles:

1) Dynamically generate virtual C<A>, C<AAAA>, and/or C<CNAME> records
according to whatever logic the plugin author wishes.  The plugin
can make use of gdnsd's monitoring services for being failover-aware,
and the actual zonefile records that trigger these lookups are C<DYNA>
(for address-only data) and C<DYNC> (for which the plugin can return
C<CNAME> or address results).

2) Provide custom protocols and implementations for the back-end of the
monitoring code for use by any plugin.  In this case you mostly just
implement the protocol check code against a standard libev event loop
and use a helper function to report the results of each status check,
and the core takes care of the rest.

All callbacks can be implemented by all plugins; it is possible to
create a combined plugin that performs both roles.  There is no clear
distinction between plugin "types" internally.

=head1 USER-LEVEL CONFIGURATION FOR DYNA/DYNC

If you haven't read the documentation for the overall configuration
file (L<gdnsd.config>) and the zonefiles (L<gdnsd.zonefile>), you might
want to read those before continuing.

From a user's perspective, there are two parts to configuring plugins.
The first is configuring the plugin via the gdnsd config file.  The
config file has an optional C<plugins> hash.  The keys of this hash are
the names of plugins to load, and the values (which must be hashes) are
the configuration data for the plugin itself.  e.g., to load two
plugins named C<foo> and C<bar>, the plugins hash might look like this:

  plugins => {
    foo => {
       opts => {
          something = "quux\000<-an_embedded_null!",
          somethingelse = { Z => z },
       },
       xyz = [x, y, z]
    }
    bar => { x => y }
  }

Note that a short-form plugin name (e.g. C<foo>) maps to a shared
library named F<plugin_foo.so>.  Plugins will be loaded from the
directory F<$PREFIX/lib/gdnsd/> by default, but this path can be
overridden in the C<options> section of the gdnsd configuration.

The basic syntactic structure of your plugin's config hash follows the
same rules as the gdnsd config as a whole.  This is the C<vscf> syntax,
which allows the user to specify nested data in the form of hashes,
arrays, and simple values.  It's entirely up to the plugin author how
the contents of the hash should be interpreted, and to document the
plugin's config hash for users.

The second part of the configuration is inserting C<DYNA> and/or
C<DYNC> resource records into zonefiles.  C<DYNA> RRs use a plugin to
dynamically generate C<A> and/or C<AAAA> RRs, while C<DYNC> RRs use a
plugin to dynamically generate either C<A>/C<AAAA> RRs or C<CNAME> RRs.

  www      300 DYNA foo!prod_web
  www.test 300 DYNA foo!test_web
  web      300 DYNC bar!test_web_cname

The initial parts (the left-hand domainname, TTL, and RR-type) follow
the usual zonefile norms, other than the fact that C<DYNA> is not a
real resource record type in the DNS protocol.  The rdata section (e.g.
C<foo!prod_web>) contains two parts separated by an C<!>: A plugin
name, and a resource name.

The meaning of the resource name is entirely up to the plugin.
Typically it will reference a configuration key from the plugin's
configuration hash as a mapping to a specific set of parameters for the
plugin, but other uses of this field are possible.

Plugins may implement just address results, just CNAME results, or
both.

=head1 USER-LEVEL CONFIGURATION FOR MONITORING

DYNA/DYNC plugin code can optionally take advantage of monitoring
services, e.g. to not return "dead" addresses from a pool.  Monitoring
is configured as a set of C<service_types>, each representing a
protocol, protocol-specific parameters, and some generic parameters
related to timing and anti-flap.
e.g.:

    service_types = {
        prod_web = {
            plugin = http_status
            # plugin-specific parameters
            vhost = www.example.com
            url_path = /checkme
            ok_codes = [ 200, 201 ]
            # generic parameters
            up_thresh = 24
            down_thresh = 16
            ok_thresh = 8
            interval = 8
            timeout = 4
        }
    }

A service type is meant to be re-used to monitor the same service at
several different addresses.

One of the service type parameters is C<plugin>, naming a custom
monitoring plugin to load.  If this plugin was not listed directly in
the C<plugins> hash to give it global-level configuration, it will be
loaded with no configuration at all (C<_load_config(NULL)>).
C<http_status> is the default plugin, which does simplistic HTTP/1.0
requests and checks only the HTTP status code returned by the server.

=head1 PLUGIN SOURCE ORGANIZATION

There must be one primary plugin source file which implements the
callback hooks, and this file must include the following before any
other code:

    #define GDNSD_PLUGIN_NAME foo
    #include <gdnsd/plugin.h>

If you wish to split your implementation over multiple files, you can
access the relevant API interfaces via the other C<gdnsd-*.h> headers
directly.  However all of the actual callback hooks must be implemented
in the primary source file, and your other source files should B<not>
include C<gdnsd/plugin.h>.

=head1 RUNTIME CALLBACK FLOW

To understand how plugins operate and how to write plugins, it is
necessary to understand the overall flow of gdnsd's execution, and
where in that flow various callbacks are made into the code of the
loaded plugins.  If you haven't yet read the main L<gdnsd> daemon
documentation at this point, now would be a good time, as it covers
some basic info about how gdnsd acts as its own initscript.  All
callbacks have the name of the plugin in the function name, and we will
use the example name C<foo> for documentation purposes.  A brief
summary of all of the API interfaces and semantics follows in a later
section, but it would be good to read through this lengthy prose
explanation at least once.

=head2 CONFIGURATION

Anytime the gdnsd binary is executed (assuming there is no immediate
error in parsing the commandline arguments), if (and only if) the
action is C<checkconf>, or one of the startup actions (C<start>,
C<restart>, C<condrestart>), it will load the gdnsd configuration file.
 Other actions (such as C<stop> or C<status>) do not load the daemon
config file, and do not load plugins or invoke their callbacks.

As soon as the configuration file as a whole has been validated and
loaded, gdnsd goes about setting various internal parameters from this
data.  When it encounters the C<plugins> hash, it will load and
configure the named plugins.  Immediately after loading each plugin, it
will execute the C<plugin_foo_load_config()> callback, providing the
plugin code with its vscf configuration hash.  At this time the plugin
should walk (and validate) the provided configuration data and set up
its own internal parameters based on this data.  In the case of many
simple daemon actions (e.g. C<stop>), there will be no further plugin
callbacks after this point, and execution will cease shortly.  Because
of this, any expensive configuration steps should be avoided in the
load_config callback.  Your goal in load_config is to validate your
configuration data and store it somewhere, nothing more.

You may also return a C<mon_list_t*> from load_config (or NULL if not
applicable).  This defines the resources your plugin wants the core
daemon to monitor via its internal HTTP state checker, so that you can
implement simple failover policies easily.

Next, C<service_types> are processed from the config.  These may
autoload additional plugins that were not specified in the C<plugins>
hash.  They will also receive a C<plugin_foo_load_config(NULL)> call if
autoloaded.

For each service type that uses a given plugin, the plugin will receive
a C<plugin_foo_add_svctype()> callback.  Use this to set up local data
structures for each service type you've been assigned.

Next, all of the C<mon_list_t*>'s that were returned by all
C<plugin_foo_load_config()> calls will be processed, which results in
per-address callbacks to monitoring plugins'
C<plugin_foo_add_monitor()>.  This is when a monitoring plugin sets up
per-address data structures.

The next callback will be C<plugin_foo_full_config()>.  This is an
ideal time for a monitoring plugin to do any global config/setup
operations that need to happen after all C<plugin_foo_add_monitor()>,
or for a resolver plugin to initialize per-iothread data.  The sole
argument provided to this callback is num_threads, which is the total
count of I/O threads that will exist at runtime, in case you need it in
order to allocate per-thread data.  They are numbered from zero to
num_threads - 1.  The thread number of the calling thread will be
passed to to other relevant callbacks later, when they are executed in
I/O thread context.

After full_config, the daemon loads and parses all zonefiles,
constructing the internal runtime DNS database.  During the zonefile
loading phase, when it encounters C<DYNA> RRs in zonefiles, they will
trigger the plugin callback C<plugin_foo_map_res> once for
every C<DYNA> RR, with a C<NULL> C<origin> argument.  The same occurs
with all C<DYNC> RRs, and they will get non-C<NULL> C<origin> arguments,
which indicate the current C<$ORIGIN> in effect for the RR.  It is
important to note that your plugin should treat it as an error if
it gets a C<_map_res> call with a C<NULL> C<origin> (DYNA) for a resource
which is configured to be capable of returning C<CNAME> results.

If your DYNC plugin supports variable origins (e.g. the same resource
name can be re-used in multiple zonefiles, and prepends some standard
domainname fragment to origin in effect for the given RR), it is
important that you validate that you can construct a legal domainname
(length limits) from the given origin, resource name, and your own
config at this time.

Plugins should B<not> return different resource numbers for the same
resname argument regardless of C<origin> value (or lack thereof).  You
will break things if you do so.

If your map_resource operation fails (e.g. unknown resource name, or
illegal origin-based C<CNAME> construction, or a NULL origin argument (DYNA)
for a resource that could return C<CNAME> data), log the error and return -1.
Do B<not> fail fatally, as these calls happen at runtime during dynamic
zonefile reloads.

In the case of the action C<checkconf>, execution stops here.  Only the
C<start> and C<restart> actions continue on to become full-fledged
daemon instances.

=head2 RUNTIME

At this point in time, more daemon setup occurs, including the act of
daemonization if applicable.  The next callback you will receive
is C<plugin_foo_post_daemonize()>.  After that, the daemon does some
runtime setup such as creating DNS listening sockets, etc.

The next callback you will receive is C<plugin_foo_pre_privdrop>.  This
is your plugin's last chance to take any actions which may require
special operating system privileges (such as opening low-numbered
listening sockets, or opening most files in general).  Immediately
after the pre_privdrop callback, the daemon drop all privileges (if
applicable).

After dropping privileges, gdnsd will initialize (but not yet enter)
the libev event loop which controls the primary thread of execution at
runtime.  This primary thread of execution handles all functionality
other than the actual handling of DNS requests.  This includes such
things as reacting to process signals, reporting stats data to syslog
and to users via HTTP, and doing all monitoring-plugin actions to
monitor address resources.  Two monitoring plugin callbacks happen at
this stage:

The first is C<plugin_foo_init_monitors()>.  You will be passed the
event loop, and you are expected to set up events that will do a single
monitoring check on all monitored resources and then clear themselves
and not repeat.  When all plugins have done their init_monitors(), the
loop will be run, and it is expected to terminate after a few seconds
when all monitoring states have been initialized with real-world data.

The next is C<plugin_foo_start_monitors()>.  Again you are passed the
same libev loop, and you add all of your monitored resource callbacks,
but this time it's permanent: they're expected to repeat their
monitoring checks endlessly the next time the loop is invoked.

When your libev monitoring callbacks have determined a success or
failure for a monitored resource, they're expected to call the helper
function C<gdnsd_mon_state_updater()> from F<gdnsd/mon.h> to send the
state info upstream for anti-flap calculations and re-destribution to
plugins which are monitoring the given resource.

If your plugin (of any type) has asynchronous maintenance/management
tasks that can be implemented as libev watchers (sockets, timeouts,
etc), you may register libev events into the main loop at this time,
via the optional callback C<plugin_foo_pre_run>.  The callback will be
provided with a pointer to the libev loop.  You should not invoke the
loop, or alter any loop-global settings.  The loop will already have
several watchers defined in it when your callback is executed which you
should not touch.

After pre_run, gdnsd will spawn the runtime DNS I/O threads.  For each
such thread, the callback C<plugin_foo_iothread_init> will be called
from within each I/O thread with the global thread number as the only
argument (0 through num_threads-1, where num_threads was provided to
you back at full_config).  This would be the ideal time to malloc()
writable per-thread data structures from within the threads themselves,
so that a thread-aware malloc can avoid false sharing.

At this point, gdnsd is ready to begin serving DNS queries.  After all
I/O threads have finished initialization (and thus moved on to already
serving requests), the primary thread will enter the libev loop
mentioned above and remain under its control until daemon exit time.
During this time the only direct callback your plugin will receive
from I/O thread contexts is C<plugin_foo_resolve>.  If you registered
any libev watchers during pre_run, you will also receive relevant
callbacks there in the main thread's execution context.

As a general style rule, the runtime resolver callback is not allowed
to block or fail.  It is expected to respond immediately with valid
response data.  It is your job as the plugin author to ensure this is
the case.  That means pre-allocating memory, pre-loading data, and/or
pre-calculating anything expensive during earlier callbacks.  Worst
case, you can return meaningless data, e.g. C<0.0.0.0> for C<DYNA> or
some hostname like C<plugin.is.broken.> for C<DYNC>, but ideally all
possible error conditions have been checked out beforehand.

C<_resolve> is supplied with a resource number, a thread number,
a result structure your code can use to supply address information to
the client, a C<client_info_t> structure giving network information
about the querying client, and an C<origin> argument.

The resource number and origin will match with earlier C<map_res>
calls your plugin received.

The C<client_info_t> structure contains the querying DNS cache's
address as well as optional edns-client-subnet address+mask
information.  If the mask is zero, there was no (useful)
edns-client-subnet information, and the plugin must fall back to using
the cache's address.  When edns-client-subnet information is present,
the edns-client-subnet output "scope" mask must be set in the result
structure (to zero if the information went unused, or to a specific
scope as defined in the edns-client-subnet draft (could be shorter or
longer than the client's specified mask)).

There is no distinction between A and AAAA requests (for that matter,
your plugin could be invoked to provide Additional-section addresses
for other requested types like MX or SRV).  You must answer with all
applicable IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on every call.  Generally speaking,
gdnsd treats A and AAAA much like a single RR-set.  Both are always
included in the additional section when appropriate.  In response to a
direct query for A or AAAA, the daemon returns the queried address RR
type in the answer section and the other in the additional section.

In the callback result structure C<dyn_result_t>, TTLs are pre-set from the
effective TTL of the triggering record in the zonefile, but can be
modified by the plugin (for example, to shorten the TTL during failure
or near-failure events for a plugin that uses monitoring).

The boolean return value of the resolve callback is used for your
plugin to indicate resource-level failure to higher-level meta-plugins
such as C<metafo> or C<geoip>.  If your resource is completely "failed",
fill in the best results you can (perhaps pretend all addresses are up)
and return C<false>.  If your resource is not failed, return C<true>.
The higher-level plugin may or may not choose to use your "failed"
results anyways, depending on the state of other configured resources.

When a signal is sent to stop the daemon, the primary thread's libev
loop will return and no further watcher callbacks (set up via pre_run()
or start_monitors()) will be invoked.  The main daemon will syslog()
some final stats output and invoke C<exit()> to terminate the process.
This in turn unwinds the stack of C<atexit()> handlers.  First will be
a handler which cancels and joins all of the outstanding I/O threads,
then comes another which invokes each plugin's C<plugin_foo_exit()>
from the main thread's context.  You can log any stats output you wish
here, and/or destruct any resources you wish (no worry about races from
io thread access, they're all dead now).

The C<map_res> callback may also be
called at any time during normal runtime as a result of zonefiles being
dynamically reloaded.  These should be readonly operations so there
shouldn't be any locking concerns.  It's important that these calls
never fail fatally.  Simply log an error and return -1.

=head1 THREADING

gdnsd uses POSIX threads.  Only the runtime resolve callback (
C<plugin_foo_resolve> needs to to concern itself with thread safety.
It can and will be called from multiple POSIX threads simultaneously
for runtime requests.

The simplest (but least-performant) way to ensure thread-safety would
be to wrap the contents of these functions in a pthread mutex.
However, for most imaginable cases, it should be trivial to structure
your data and code such that these functions can be both lock-free and
thread-safe.

=head1 CORE API DETAILS

These are the functions exported by the core gdnsd code, which are
available for your plugin to call at runtime.  They're implemented
in a library named C<libgdnsd>, which the gdnsd daemon has already
loaded before loading your plugin.  You don't need to (and shouldn't)
explicitly link against libgdnsd.  The interfaces are defined in a set
of header files grouped by functionality.  Note that in your
primary plugin source file which includes F<gdnsd/plugin.h>, all of
these header files have already been included for you indirectly.

For now, the documentation of these interfaces exists solely in
the header files themselves.  I'm still trying to sort out how to
document them correctly, probably doxygen.

=head1 GENERAL PLUGIN CODING CONVENTIONS, ETC

All syslog/stderr -type output should be handled via the thread-safe
C<log_*()> and C<logf_*()> calls provided by gdnsd.  Do not attempt to
use stderr (or stdout/stdin) or syslog directly.  To throw a fatal
error and abort daemon execution, use C<log_fatal()>, which does not
return.

Build your plugin with C<-DNDEBUG> unless you're actually debugging
development code, and make liberal use of C<assert()> and
C<log_debug()> where applicable.

You do not declare function prototypes for the callback functions
(plugin_foo_*).  The prototypes are declared for you when you include
the F<gdnsd/plugin.h> header.  You need merely define the functions
themselves.

There is an internal API version number documented at the top of this
document and set in C<gdnsd/plugapi.h>.  This number is only
incremented when incompatible changes are made to the plugin API
interface or semantics which require recompiling plugins and/or
updating their code.  When gdnsd is compiled this version number is
hardcoded into the daemon binary.  When plugins are compiled the API
version they were built against is also hardcoded into the plugin
object automatically.  When gdnsd loads a plugin object, it checks for
an exact match of plugin API version.  If the number does not match, a
fatal error will be thrown telling the user the plugin needs to be
rebuilt against the gdnsd version in use.

The current API version number is available to your code as the macro
C<GDNSD_PLUGIN_API_VERSION>.  If necessary, you can test this value via
C<#if> macro logic to use alternate code for different API versions (or
simply to error out if the API version is too old for your plugin code).

=head1 RECENT API CHANGES

This is meant as a guide for authors of any 3rd party plugins trying
to update for new changes, and generally covers only the most recent
few sets of such changes.

=head2 Version 11

Baseline for the changes below, was the API for the stable 1.8.x
release series.

=head2 Version 12

This corresponds with the release of 1.10.0

Only the vscf config-file API changed in this version, which only
really affects plugins that were loading external vscf
configuration files on their own (as opposed to just receiving
data from the main config file's plugins stanza).  There aren't
any 3rd party plugins doing this that I'm aware of, but it
does technically warrant an API compatibility bump.

The first of the vscf API changes was the removal of the fd
and stream input functions vscf_scan_fd() and vscf_scan_stream(),
leaving only the vscf_scan_filename() variant.

The other change is that the data item returned by vscf_scan_filename()
can now be a hash or an array, whereas before the syntax of vscf's
config language only permitted it to be a hash.  Code which expects
a hash must now explicitly check that the result was not an array.

=head2 Version 13

Unreleased, work-in-progress, will probably be 2.x release series...

The data structures C<dynaddr_result_t> and C<dyncname_result_t> were
merged and replaced with a single structure C<dyn_result_t>, which
has direct storage for the C<CNAME> data unioned with the same basic
address structure that was in C<dynaddr_result_t>.  There's a new flag
C<is_cname> in the new structure which plugins should set to indicate
which half of the union results (cname or address) the plugin placed
results in.

The C<_map_res_dyna()> and C<_map_res_dync()> callbacks were merged
and renamed to just C<_map_res()>.  The new call has an origin argument
like the old C<_map_res_dync()>, which will be NULL when called for
C<DYNA> RRs, and the C<result> argument's type was
changed from C<dynaddr_result_t*> to C<dyn_result_t*>.

The C<_resolve_dynaddr()> and C<_resolve_dyncname()> callbacks were
merged and renamed to just C<_resolve()>.  The new call has an origin
argument like the old C<_resolve_dyncame()>, which will be NULL when
called for C<DYNA> RRs, and the C<result> argument's type was
changed from C<dynaddr_result_t*> to C<dyn_result_t*>.

C<gdnsd_dynaddr_add_result_anysin()> was renamed to
C<gdnsd_dyn_add_result_anysin()>, and the C<result> argument's type was
changed from C<dynaddr_result_t*> to C<dyn_result_t*>.

=over 4

=item map_res consistency

The C<_map_res()> callback, if implemented, B<must> return a consistent,
singular resource number for a given resource name, regardless of any
C<origin> argument or the lack thereof.

=item ignoring origin for address-only data

If a plugin only handles addresses (for this resource, or in the general
case), it should not fail on C<_map_res()> or C<_resolve()> just because an
origin is defined, indicating a C<DYNC> RR.  It should instead simply ignore
any origin argument and act as it always did.

=item map_res DYNA validity checks

If a resource name passed to C<_map_res()> is configured to be capable of
returning C<CNAME> data and the C<origin> argument is C<NULL> (indicating
a C<DYNA> RR), the plugin B<must> fail by returning -1.  One of the implications
of this rule is that for any plugin which is capable of returning C<CNAME> data
at all, C<_map_res()> B<must> be implemented.  Another implication of this
(combined with the consistency rule) is that it's no longer legal to structure
plugin resources such that they have unrelated sets of address and C<CNAME> data
stored under the same resource name, as the weighted plugin originally did before
its matching set of changes.
