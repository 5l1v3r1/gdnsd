*** Subdirs ***

rpm: RPM packaging stuff, currently a specfile and an initscript,
  both of which should hopefully work for Redhat-ish distros.

misc: Various user-contributed initscripts.  These tend to use
  the distros' style, whereas the one in pkg/rpm/ lets gdnsd
  manage itself, which I like better.
