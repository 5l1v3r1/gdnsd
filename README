## Overview

gdnsd is an Authoritative-only DNS server. The initial g stands for Geographic, as gdnsd offers a plugin system for geographic (or other sorts of) balancing, redirection, and service-state-conscious failover. The plugin system can also do things like weighted address/cname records.  If you don't care about these features you can ignore them :).

gdnsd is written in C using libev and pthreads with a focus on high performance, low latency service. It does not offer any form of caching or recursive service, and does not support DNSSEC.  There's a strong focus on making the code efficient, lean, and resilient.  The core DNS code has decent regression testsuite and scripted validation of valgrind (and some other tools') verification.

## Portability

The primary target platform is modern x86_64 Linux.  The code also compiles and works fine on MacOS X.  In theory, it should be portable to any reasonably-modern POSIXy platform with a good C99 compiler.  Several releases ago I spent some effort testing that it did in fact compile, pass tests, and operate correctly at runtime on a number of *BSDs, OpenSolaris w/ Sun's compiler, and even an embedded Linux router with a big-endian MIPS CPU.  YMMV on such targets with the modern codebase as I only regularly test Linux and Mac targets, but clean portability patches are always welcome.
