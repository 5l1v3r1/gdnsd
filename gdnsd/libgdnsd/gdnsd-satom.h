 * satom_t and friends:
 *
 * These are not for true atomic operations !!
 *
 * These are special purpose constructs, to be used only
 * in certain circumstances.  I'm calling them "semi-atomic".
 *
 * It assumes that read and write operations to a volatile
 * uinptr_t are atomic (as in nobody will ever see an intermediate,
 * half-updated uintptr_t) with respect to POSIX threads.
 * This is used for one writer + many readers, not for concurrent
 * writes and certainly not for concurrent read-modify-write.
 *
 * This isn't a portable set of assumptions (I don't think),
 * but it should work fine on sane, mainstream, modern targets.
